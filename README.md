# PIL-DataBending-Walkthrough-Project
For my project, I've decided to do some research into image manipulation with inspiration from glitch art. I've found PIL (Python Imaging Library) and wrote up some code that allows you to alter a digital image of choice in certain/specific ways.  This includes effects like 'blend', 'contour', 'sharpen' and much more.
